# pycasino

Simple text based casino written in Python 3.13. Intended to run in a terminal window.
\
Run by cloning the repo or downloading the zip, and running the main file (casino.py).
\
\
The other files are the games themselves, organized into modules for convenience, as well as a utilities file, containing functions used throughout the code.
\
\
I plan to rewrite this in another repo in other languages when I get around to it. I've found that making simple games and simulations in a terminal is the easiest and most rewarding way to get comfortable with a language.
